## What is LinGoose?

[LinGoose](https://github.com/henomis/lingoose) is a Go framework for building awesome AI/LLM applications.<br/>

- **LinGoose is modular** â€” You can import only the modules you need to build your application.
- **LinGoose is an abstraction of features** â€” You can choose your preferred implementation of a feature and/or create your own.
- **LinGoose is a complete solution** â€” You can use LinGoose to build your AI/LLM application from the ground up.



## Quick start
1. [Initialise a new go module](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module)

```sh
mkdir example
cd example
go mod init example
```

2. Create your first LinGoose application

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/henomis/lingoose/llm/openai"
)

func main() {

  llm := openai.NewCompletion()

  response, err := llm.Completion(context.Background(), "Tell me a joke about geese")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(response)

}
```

3. Install the Go dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

4. Start the example application

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

go run .

A goose fills its car with goose-line!
```
